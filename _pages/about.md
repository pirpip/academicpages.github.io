Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the Economics Department at Cornell University. 

My areas of research are Firm Dynamics, Trade, knowledge diffusion and Innovations. 

My current works focus on interactions among firm-to-firm trade, exclusive contracts and productivity (technology) diffusions.  
 
I am on the job market during the 2021-2022 cycle.
